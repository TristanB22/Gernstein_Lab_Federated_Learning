# Gernstein_Lab_Federated_Learning

This respository contains all of the code for creating a federated learning environment. The purpose of the project is to test different attacks on the example environments to expose where federated learning is insecure and can be improved. 

In order to run the baseline federated learning process found in this repository, please navigate to `Base Code/` and run the `main.py` file. This repository will be updated with more experiments that can be run as they are devised and created. 

The data that is used in this example project is provided by the [Dr. Wolberg at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original). However, the code can be trivially altered to allow for other datasets to be used instead. 

This project is supervised by the Gernstein Lab at Yale. Please reach out to the author, [Tristan Brigham](mailto:tristan.brigham@yale.edu) with any questions.
